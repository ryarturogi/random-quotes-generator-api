# Random Quote Generator API

This API allows you to generate random quotes based on a given input.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 12 or higher
- OpenAI API key

## Installing

```
1. Clone the repository to your local machine

git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/random-quote-generator-api.git

2. Go to the project directory

cd random-quote-generator-api

3. Install the dependencies

npm install


4. Set your OpenAI API key in the `config/index.js` file

export default {
  OPENAI_API_KEY: '<YOUR_API_KEY>',
  OPENAI_API_URL: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/completions'
}

5. Start the server

npm start

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/generate-quote`.
```

## Usage

- Send a `POST` request to the `/generate-quote` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the `input` field.

- The response will be a JSON object containing the generated quote.

#### Example

```
{
"quote": "The quote generated by the API"
}
```

## Deployment

To deploy the API to a production environment, you should consider the following steps:

- Use a process manager such as PM2 or forever to keep the server running
- Use a reverse proxy such as Nginx to handle HTTPS connections
- Use a logging service such as Loggly or Splunk to collect and analyze the logs
- Use a monitoring service such as New Relic or Prometheus to monitor the performance of the API
