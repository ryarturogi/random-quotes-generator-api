# Random Quote Generator API

This API allows you to generate random quotes based on a given input and language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A Vercel account
- A GitHub or GitLab repository for the project
- OpenAI API key
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/ryarturogi/random-quote-generator-api.git

Go to the project directory
cd random-quote-generator-api

Install the dependencies
npm install

Set your OpenAI API key in the .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY: '<YOUR_API_KEY>',
OPENAI_API_URL: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/completions'

Start the server
npm run dev or yarn dev

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080/generate-quote.

## Usage

- Send a `POST` request to the `/generate-quote` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the `input` field and the `language` field.

- The response will be a JSON object containing the generated quote.

#### Example

{
"quote": "The quote generated by the API",
"language": "english"
}

## Deployment

To deploy the API to a production environment on Vercel, you should consider the following steps:

- Connect your repository to your Vercel account
- Set your OpenAI API key in the `config/index.js` file as an environment variable in Vercel
- Use a logging service such as Loggly or Splunk to collect and analyze the logs
- Use a monitoring service such as New Relic or Prometheus to monitor the performance of the API
